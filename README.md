The library which implements all the routines necessary for loudspeaker beamforming on a computer. 

## Getting Started

#### Physical Requirements:

To run and playback processed signals, the minimum you need is a laptop and some standalone speakers. However, to really experience beamforming you need a beamforming array and way to physically output to more than just one audio channel simultaneously. It is recomended to use something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010L4IXUS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) paired with a USB hub to drive a large amount of speakers. 

#### Software Requirements:

You need some version of Python 3 to use PyBeam, preferably Python 3.6 or higher. Moreover, PyBeam also has a dependancy on some Python libraries found [here](requirements.txt).
